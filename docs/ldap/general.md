# LDAP

## What is LDAP?

[LDAP](/acronyms) is a common way to access directories. These directories hold info about resources from different systems and services in a distributed setup. It simplifies the management of user accounts, groups, and other directory-related data by providing a centralized platform for storing and accessing this information. F.e. when a user attempts to access a resource, they forward a request to the [LDAP](/acronyms) authentication server. This server then verifies the provided username-password combination against the directory data. Upon finding a match, it proceeds to confirm the user's authorization to access the requested resource.
