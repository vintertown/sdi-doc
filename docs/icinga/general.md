## What is Icinga?

[Icinga](/acronyms) is an open-source monitoring and alerting system designed to keep an eye on the availability and performance of various resources in a network.

## How does Icinga work?

1. Monitoring: User define hosts (devices or servers) and services (such as [HTTP](/acronyms), [DNS](/acronyms), [CPU](/acronyms) usage) they want to monitor in configuration files. These files specify parameters like IP addresses, check intervals, and notification settings.
2. Status and performance: The results of these checks are then used to determine the current status and performance metrics of the monitored resources. The status can be OK, Warning, Critical, or Unknown.
3. Notifications: When Icinga detects a problem or a change in status, it can send notifications to alert the relevant parties. Notifications can be sent via email, SMS, or other communication channels.
4. Logging and Auditing: [Icinga](/acronyms) logs events and activities, providing administrators with information for troubleshooting and auditing purposes. Log files are essential for identifying issues, analyzing performance trends, and ensuring the overall health of the monitoring system.
