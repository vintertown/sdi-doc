# Forwarders

## What are DNS Forwarders?

DNS forwarders serve several purposes in a network infrastructure. Generally, all the servers meant to convert domain names into IP addresses are assigned a specific forwarder for forwarding all the requests they canâ€™t resolve.

## Example

Enable recursive queries to parent name servers enabling your own private name server to resolve external machines like www.w3.org by delegation.

Tip: You may have to disable DNSSEC in order to allow for recursive queries.

```ssh
acl goodclients {
	localhost;
	localnets;
};

options {
	...
```

```ssh
acl goodclients {
	localhost;
	localnets;
};

options {
	...
	recursion yes;
	allow-query { goodclients; };

	dnssec-validation auto;
	...
	 forwarders {
			8.8.8.8;
			8.8.4.4;
		};
		forward only;
	...
};
```
