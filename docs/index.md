# Welcome visitor!

This is the documentation of the [SDI lecture](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/vorlesung_detail?vorlid=5213729) by Florian Winkler (fw061) and Niklas Vinterstad (nv023). We used Prof. Dr. Goik's [lecture notes](https://freedocs.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/sdi.html) as our main source and oriented ourselves on the information presented. All other sources are referenced at the end of each section. You can find a list of the acronyms used in the last chapter.

For the documentation we used MkDocs, which is based on Markdown. Feel free to give it a try [here](https://www.mkdocs.org).

Happy reading! :)
