# Apache Web Server

## What is an Apache Web Server?

Apache is an open-source web server. It is actively maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. Although the functioning of a web server is very complex, the basic task of all web servers is to accept requests from clients (e.g. a visitor's web browser) and then send the response to that request (e.g. the website the visitor wants to see).
