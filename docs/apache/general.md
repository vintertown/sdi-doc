# Apache Web Server

## What is an Apache Web Server?

Apache is an open-source web server. It is actively maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. Although the functioning of a web server is complex, the basic task of all web servers is to accept requests from clients (e.g. a visitor's web browser) and then send the response to that request (e.g. the website the visitor wants to see). Apache is cross-platform, which means it can run on various operating systems including Linux, Unix, Windows, and macOS. It supports multiple programming languages such as PHP, Python and Ruby, making it versatile for hosting dynamic websites and web applications. 

We us Apache for our Linux based Web Server.
