MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the mkdocs.yml configuration file, and then start the server by running the mkdocs serve command

Open up http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser, and you'll see the default home page being displayed

After you checkout the primary working branch (main) of the git repository where you maintain the source documentation for your project, run the following command:

`mkdocs gh-deploy`

`mkdocs serve`
