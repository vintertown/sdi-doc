DNS , or the Domain Name System, is a hierarchical and distributed naming system that is fundamental to the functioning of the Internet. It serves as a translator between human-readable domain names and numerical IP addresses. It is indispencible for accessing services on the internet. Only with the DNS can an internet user access a website by entering a URL or send an email with a domain ending (e.g. @hdm-stuttgart.de). How does DNS work? DNS works through a hirahierarchical, distributed order. A user enters an URL (e.g., www.beispieldomain.de) into a web browser or another application. (When cache is not empty) The user's device checks its local DNS resolver (typically provided by the Internet Service Provider or configured manually). This resolver may have a cache of recently resolved domain names. When there is no cache available the root server is the first step in translating the given host names into IP addresses. It will point to the top-level domain of the given domain name. Top-level domain server (like denic) is responsible for translating the domain which the user bought (e.g. beispieldomain.de) to the given IP address. The top-level domain server provides informations about the authoritative DNS server. The authoritative DNS server for the second-level domain (e.g., \"beispieldomain.de\") holds information about the requested host name (e.g., \"www\"). It is this server that can provide the IP address associated with the specific host name. Good to know DENIC operates a worldwide network of name servers to provide the name service for the German top-level domain .de and the German ENUM domain .9.4.e164.arpa. This currently comprises 19 locations in 17 cities on five continents. Types of DNS A (Address) Record: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address. AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address. CNAME (Canonical Name) Record: Alias of one domain to another. MX (Mail Exchange) Record: Specifies mail servers responsible for receiving emails for the domain. NS (Name Server) Record: Indicates authoritative DNS servers for the domain. PTR (Pointer) Record: Used for reverse DNS lookups. SOA (Start of Authority) Record: Contains information about the domain and the zone.
